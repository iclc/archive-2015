## Workshop “Fragments: Live Coding the OpenGL Fragment Shader with Audio Responsiveness”
*Shawn Lawson*

I think what strikes me most about giving the workshop and my overall experience of the first ICLC is the sense of community and openness. It reminds me of when I was attending ACM SIGGRAPH in the late 1990’s. Computer graphics hadn’t really grown beyond the research lab very much with a few industry exceptions; and so, capitalizing on closed source rendering algorithms/hardware, lowest-bidding special effects houses, and general commercialization hadn’t yet really started. The core of CGI was a group of people who wanted to simply make computer graphics, share with their friends, and trade ideas. This is was I saw happening at ICLC, and I felt like this made things livelier, friendlier, fewer cliques, esteemed luminaries more approachable and so on.

Concerning the workshop directly, I was really happy to see the large interest in the live coding graphics. I hope the workshop benefited those who attended. I know that I learned an enormous amount from watching them use the tool, especially how they find bugs, discover errors, and develop usage patterns. The attendees had many excellent ideas for features or changes that they would like to have - many of which I’m planning to implement. For me, giving the workshop was incredibly valuable as a live coder, software developer, and teacher. I would gladly do it again; would like to think that attendees would gladly choose the workshop again too.
